# Twitter Clone

This is a project working similarly to a real social network like Facebook and Twitter but mainly it likens to Twitter. The main idea is to simply just practice code and styling in preparation for a real projects.
PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS are used in the project.

## Configuration
Replace the name of the file 

```php
db.php.example 
```

```php
db.php
```
Then according to the

```sql

```

After that fill in the info in the

file.

And that is it! You can make your own account with Username, Email and Password. You can change your password afterwards and publish a tweet with everithing on your mind.
